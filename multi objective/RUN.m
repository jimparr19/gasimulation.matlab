    % Select the parents
    % Parents are selected for reproduction to generate offspring. The
    % original NSGA-II uses a binary tournament selection based on the
    % crowded-comparision operator. The arguments are 
    % pool - size of the mating pool. It is common to have this to be half the
    %        population size.
    % tour - Tournament size. Original NSGA-II uses a binary tournament
    %        selection, but to see the effect of tournament size this is kept
    %        arbitary, to be choosen by the user.

    % Selection process
    % A binary tournament selection is employed in NSGA-II. In a binary
    % tournament selection process two individuals are selected at random
    % and their fitness is compared. The individual with better fitness is
    % selcted as a parent. Tournament selection is carried out until the
    % pool size is filled. Basically a pool size is the number of parents
    % to be selected. The input arguments to the function
    % tournament_selection are chromosome, pool, tour. The function uses
    % only the information from last two elements in the chromosome vector.
    % The last element has the crowding distance information while the
    % penultimate element has the rank information. Selection is based on
    % rank and if individuals with same rank are encountered, crowding
    % distance is compared. A lower rank and higher crowding distance is
    % the selection criteria.

    % Perfrom crossover and Mutation operator
    % The original NSGA-II algorithm uses Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) and
    % Polynomial  mutation. Crossover probability pc = 0.9 and mutation
    % probability is pm = 1/n, where n is the number of decision variables.
    % Both real-coded GA and binary-coded GA are implemented in the original
    % algorithm, while in this program only the real-coded GA is considered.

    % and mum = 20 respectively.
